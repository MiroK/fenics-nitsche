This repository tries to compare `classical` FEM formulations of different
physical problems with Nitsche and Babuska penalty formulations. The term
`classical` refers to a formulation where Dirichlet boundary conditions are
enforced via trial spaces. With Nitsche and Babuska methods, these conditions
enter weak forms weakly.

With all the problems, articles that were used either as a template or
inspiration for the formulations are listed.
